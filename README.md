# Weather App with ReactJS and Vite

Weather app is my fifteenth day of doing a 50 Day Challenge to code using React JS! I'm also using Vite and Sass in this code.

I'm using the openweathermap API to display the weather based on the location of the user's device. There is also a weather search feature based on the city entered.
